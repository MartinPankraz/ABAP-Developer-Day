# Quest 2 - Apprentice's curious road

[< Quest 1](quest1.md) - **[üè†Home](../README.md)** - [ Quest 3 >](quest3.md)

Now that we have the Logic App in place to fetch data from the SAP system and create an Adaptive Card in Teams, we want to trigger this flow automatically from the SAP System once a new order is placed in the Online Shop.

For this we will enhance the SAP System to react on the custom event triggered by the Online Shop. This event will then be picked up by the ABAP SDK for Azure and sent to an Azure Service Bus. From there our Logic App from Quest 1 can be triggered.


## Create a Queue in Azure Servie Bus
1) In the top level of the Azure Portal search for "ServiceBusForSAPOnlineShop" and select the Service Bus
[Select Service Bus](../img/student/Quest2/SelectServiceBus.jpg)

2) Create a new Queue by clicking on "+ Queue" and enter a Queue name, like Developer\<XXX>
[Create Queue](../img/student/Quest2/CreateQueue.jpg)

3) When you scroll down you can see the Queue that was created. 
[Verify the Queue](../img/student/Quest2/ScrollDownAndSelect.jpg)

## Create a Subscription in Azure Event Grid
1) Similar like before, in the Azure Portal search for EventsFromOnlineShop and select the Event Grid
[Select Event Grid](../img/student/Quest2/SelectEventGrid.jpg)

2) Click on "+ Subscription" and create a new subscription for the Event Grid

3) Start entering the details like, subscription name and select Azure Service Bus Queue

4) Click on "Select an endpoint" and make sure to select the Service Bus Queue for your Developer\<xxx> previous created. Then click on "Confirm Selection".
