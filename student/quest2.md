Now that we have the Logic App in place to fetch data from the SAP system and create an Adaptive Card in Teams, we want to trigger this flow automatically from the SAP System once a new order is placed in the Online Shop.

For this we will enhance the SAP System to react on the custom event triggered by the Online Shop. This event will then be picked up by the ABAP SDK for Azure and sent to an Azure Service Bus. From there our Logic App from Quest 1 can be triggered.

## Create a Queue in Azure Service Bus

1. Search from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) for `ServiceBusForSAPOnlineShop` and select the Service Bus

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Select Service Bus" src="../img/student/Quest2/SelectServiceBus.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

2. Create a new Queue by clicking on "+ Queue" and enter a Queue name, like Developer\<XXX> and click on **Create**

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Create Queue" src="../img/student/Quest2/CreateQueue.jpg"  width="800">
</p>

3. When you scroll down you can see the Queue that was created. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Verify the Queue" src="../img/student/Quest2/ScrollDownAndSelect.jpg"  width="800">
</p>

## Create a Subscription in Azure Event Grid

1. Similar like before, in the Azure Portal search for EventsFromOnlineShop and select the Event Grid

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Select Event Grid" src="../img/student/Quest2/SelectEventGrid.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

2. Click on "+ Event Subscription" and create a new subscription for the Event Grid

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Create Event Grid Subscription" src="../img/student/Quest2/CreateEventSubscription.jpg"  width="800">
</p>

3. Start entering the details like, subscription name (`Developer<xxx>Subscription`) and select **Azure Service Bus Queue** as the Endpoint Type. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Create Event Grid Subscription Details" src="../img/student/Quest2/EnterSubscriptionDetails.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

4. Click on "Select an endpoint" and make sure to select the Service Bus Queue for your Developer\<xxx> previous created. Then click on "Confirm Selection". 

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Select Endpoint" src="../img/student/Quest2/SelectEndpoint.jpg"  width="800">
</p>

5. Click on the Filter tab and click on "Add new filter"

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Add filter" src="../img/student/Quest2/AddFilter.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

6. For the filter, enter "data.createdby", select "Contains ins" and click "Add new values"

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Enter filter information" src="../img/student/Quest2/EnterFilters.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

7) Enter your SAP user, e.g. Developer\<xxx> and click on Create

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Enter Value and click on create" src="../img/student/Quest2/ValueAndCreate.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

### Test

Now events from the SAP system should be sent to the Service Bus Queue whenever a new Order is created in the Online Shop. Head over to the [Online Shop](https://vhcals4hcs.dummy.nodomain:44301/sap/bc/adt/businessservices/odatav4/feap?feapParams=C%C2%87u%C2%84C%C2%83%C2%84%C2%89C%C2%83xu%C2%88uHC%C2%87u%C2%84C%C2%8E%C2%89%7Ds%C2%83%C2%82%C2%80%7D%C2%82y%C2%87%7C%C2%83%C2%84s%C2%81%C2%87Es%C2%83HC%C2%87%C2%86%C2%8AxC%C2%87u%C2%84C%C2%8E%C2%89%7Ds%C2%83%C2%82%C2%80%7D%C2%82y%C2%87%7C%C2%83%C2%84s%C2%81%C2%87ECDDDEC77c%C2%82%C2%80%7D%C2%82ysg%7C%C2%83%C2%84777777ni%5Dscb%60%5DbYg%5CcdsagE77DDDE77ni%5Dscb%60%5DbYg%5CcdsagEscH&sap-ui-language=EN&sap-client=100) create a new Order and check for incoming events.

The easiest way is to search for `EventsFromOnlineShop` and select your Event Subscription (e.g. Developer\<xxx>Subscription) from the bottom of the page.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Navigate to Event Subscription" src="../img/student/Quest2/NavigateToEventSubscription.jpg"  width="800">
</p>

and look at the events.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Incoming Events" src="../img/student/Quest2/FirstIncomingEvent.jpg"  width="800">
</p>

## Connect the event to our Logic App

1. Now we need to change the configuration of our Logic App to react to incoming events in the Service Bus Queue. Open the Logic App created in Quest 1 and delete the first Trigger / Action (When a HTTP request is received)

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Delete the first action" src="../img/student/Quest2/LogicAppDesigner.jpg"  width="800">
</p>

> **Note**: An easy way to navigate back to your Logic App is to search for `Developer<XXX>-OrderItem` in the Search bar on the top and then selecting the **Logic app designer** view in the navigation on the left.

2. Search for "Service Bus" and select the new Trigger action "Service Bus"

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Search Service Bus" src="../img/student/Quest2/SearchServiceBus.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

3. Select **When a message is received in a queue (auto-complete)**

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="When a message is received" src="../img/student/Quest2/WhenAMessgeIsReceived.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

4. Enter a name and the Connecting string from the Service Bus Queue. Click on Create

```http
Endpoint=sb://servicebusforsaponlineshop.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=cIcJZtV87fyvpldm78OVcABI8LSw7QxRI+ASbCrll/w=
```

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Enter a name and connection string" src="../img/student/Quest2/EnterNameAndConnectionString.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

> **Note** - the Connection string can be retrieved from

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Copy connection string" src="../img/student/Quest2/CopyConnectionString.jpg"  width="800">
</p>

5. Select the Queue name that you previously created.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Select Queue" src="../img/student/Quest2/SelectQueueName.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

6. Add another action

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Add action" src="../img/student/Quest2/AddAnotherAction.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

7. Search for `Initialize variable` and add **Initialize Variable**

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Initialize Variable" src="../img/student/Quest2/InitalizeVariable.jpg"  width="500">
</p>

8. Provide a Name, e.g. `Message Content` and for the vlaue use the **Content** from the incoming Service Bus request. Then make sure to change the type from Boolean to **String**

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Set message content" src="../img/student/Quest2/SetMessageContent.jpg"  width="800">
</p>

9. As before click on the "+" to add a **Parse Json** action

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Select Parse JSON structure" src="../img/student/Quest2/ParseJson.jpg"  width="400">
</p>

10. Use the previously initialized variable and use the Schema from below.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Enter Schema" src="../img/student/Quest2/EnterSchema.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

12. Click on Save to save the Logic Apps

### Test it!

1. Open up again the [Online Shop](https://vhcals4hcs.dummy.nodomain:44301/sap/bc/adt/businessservices/odatav4/feap?feapParams=C%C2%87u%C2%84C%C2%83%C2%84%C2%89C%C2%83xu%C2%88uHC%C2%87u%C2%84C%C2%8E%C2%89%7Ds%C2%83%C2%82%C2%80%7D%C2%82y%C2%87%7C%C2%83%C2%84s%C2%81%C2%87Es%C2%83HC%C2%87%C2%86%C2%8AxC%C2%87u%C2%84C%C2%8E%C2%89%7Ds%C2%83%C2%82%C2%80%7D%C2%82y%C2%87%7C%C2%83%C2%84s%C2%81%C2%87ECDDDEC77c%C2%82%C2%80%7D%C2%82ysg%7C%C2%83%C2%84777777ni%5Dscb%60%5DbYg%5CcdsagE77DDDE77ni%5Dscb%60%5DbYg%5CcdsagEscH&sap-ui-language=EN&sap-client=100)

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Enter Order NR" src="../img/student/Quest2/OnlineShopCreate.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

2. Fill in the required properties and click on Create

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Create Order" src="../img/student/Quest2/CreateOrder.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

3. As soon as you click on create, head over to [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/) and check your channel. You should now see the Adaptive Card with your Order Item

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Adaptive Card" src="../img/student/Quest2/AdaptiveCard.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

#### Behind the scene

1. When you go back to your the Azure Event Grid Topic (search for EventsFromOnlineShop), you can see the Event coming via the ABAP SDK for Azure when a new Order is crated in the Online Shop. At the bottom you can also see the Subscription, that you had created for this event. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Adaptive Card" src="../img/student/Quest2/EventGridCheckEvent.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

> **Note**: Since we have multiple users working on the same Online Shop, you will most likely see lots of different events coming in. 

2. In this subscription we had specified a filter for your Online Shop user, that would put incoming events into an Service Bus Queue. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Adaptive Card" src="../img/student/Quest2/EventGridSubscription.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

3. Once an event is in this queue, we had created a Logic Apps trigger, that kicks off your specific flow to post an adaptive card in Teams. Open up your Logic App again and click on Run History. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Adaptive Card" src="../img/student/Quest2/RunsHistory.jpg"  width="600">
</p>

4. From there you can see the previous runs of the Logic App.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img alt="Adaptive Card" src="../img/student/Quest2/LogicAppRunHistory.jpg"  width="600">
