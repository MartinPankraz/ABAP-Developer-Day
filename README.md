# 🌌Wander across the worlds of SAP and Microsoft - Journey of an ABAP'er🪐

🏗️Under Construction🚧

`Content supporting the DSAG ABAP Developer Day February 2023`

Digitization of business processes and deriving intelligent action automatically is one of the mega trends across all industries globally. As part of this mission, should you choose to accept it, you will experience challenges and solution approaches firsthand acting as the much needed incubation team 🐣 of the Contoso Inc.

You will be expanding your ABAP developer horizon and ultimately be equipped to shape digitization efforts one step at a time. But first things first.

## 🔭 Introduction

`"what's the harm of collecting invoices manually and also typing them into your Enterprise-Resource-Planning system after all?"`

There are multiple studies and reports on automation impacts on human labor. We are quoting just two to make the point: According to the [Smartsheet report](https://www.smartsheet.com/content-center/product-news/automation/workers-waste-quarter-work-week-manual-repetitive-tasks) knowledge workers could save almost a full working day per week if their repetitive tasks were automated. What could you do with an extra day? [McKinsey's featured insight](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/five-fifty-fear-fear-not) addresses the fear of automation destroying jobs and freeing the most creative force from repetitive manual tasks in the business to work on challenges it was built for by millions of years of evolution: the human brain 🧠.

You will be using Microsoft tooling and the globally most-widely adopted ERP with your well-known ABAP environment as the foundation.

💺buckle up and get your fellow humans that extra day to work on challenges, be outdoors to get fresh ideas, socialize with colleagues, work only 4 days a week and still get their work done or just for the sake of advancing modern work.
